# Structural analysis project version 0.0.1

This is my structural analysis code for the direct stiffness method/finite element method/etc for frame and truss structures. This code works for both 2D and 3D structures.

##### Running the examples of the Extra_examples folder::

Move one of the examples to the root folder and run it

##### Running the code from Python:

Run project_examples_1/2/3/4.py directly.

##### Running the code from matlab:

Use the main_frame/truss_2D/3D.m file, acording of your needs. Modify the InputScript as needed.

##### Additional:

If you run the code from Python, a webpage opens showing the plots. This is a mini interface for interacting with the results. Click in any element for generating the internal force diagram.

Live happy, that's the deal
